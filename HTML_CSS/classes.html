            Classes are the main types of damage you can deal in Terraria; melee, ranged, magic, and summon. Each class has a different play style and pros and cons that contribute to the overall gameplay of Terraria. In Terraria you are not constrainted to one class meaning you can switch classes at anytime by simply changing the armour, acessories, and weapon you use. enjoyed shooting a bow and arrow until you saw a youtube video about a crazy spell you want to cast? dont worry, you dont need to restart your character to cast spells!

                <p><h2>Melee</h2></p>
                <p><img width="100" src="../Pictures/melee.png"/></p>
                The melee class is the tankiest of all the classes. Like the name suggest the melee class prefers to keep things up close and personal, they utilize weapons such as swords, spears, yoyos, flails, boomerangs, and many other weapons.

                <p><h2>Ranged</h2></p>
                <p><img width="70" src="../Pictures/ranged.png"/></p>
                The ranged class is a class that utilizes weapons such as bows and guns. The ranged class, unlike the other classes, has to craft not only the weapon but also the ammo (arrows and bullets) in order to use their weapon.

            <span class="grid-item">
                <p><h2>Magic</h2></p>
                <p><img width="150" src="../Pictures/magic.webp"/></p>
                The magic class has the lowest defence overall of the classes. The magic class makes use of weapons such as books, staffs, and many other wacky items. when a magic weapon is used then mana is drained from the user.

            <span class="grid-item">
                <p><h2>Summon</h2></p>
                <p><img width="150" src="../Pictures/summon.png"/></p>
                The summon class is a class that mainly relies on its minions to do the bulk of the damage. summoners mainly use staffs of summoning to summon their minions and whips so that whatever they hit with their whip their minions will attack. A summoner can increase the amount of minions he controls by equipping certain acessories and armors
