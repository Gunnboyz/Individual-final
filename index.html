            <br>

            Terraria is a game about exploring, crafting, collecting, mining, building, fighting, and so much more. The main premise of the game is to collect and craft the next tier of gear relative to the <a href="classes.html">class</a> you want to be that way you become stronger and beat the next <a href="bosses.html">boss</a> and then the cycle continues. While a gameplay loop like this might sound repetitive and boring Terraria has unique <a href="bosses.html">bosses</a>, enviroments, and encounters that makes the game always feel unique and leaves the player guessing what could possibly be the next step. one minute you might be mining platnium ore to craft armour and weapons then the next you could be fighting off an invasion of goblins! Whether you like to relax and build, run and gun, collect and farm, or even fish Terraria has it all!

            <br>

            pre-hardmode is the state of what your Terraria world is called before you beat a <a href="bosses.html">boss</a> called the wall of flesh, once you do beat the wall of flesh your world enters whats called <a href="hardmode.html">hardmode</a>. In pre-hardmode you spawn into a world with a variety of different biomes and enemies most of which you will be too weak to fight starting off. In pre-hardmode your main objective is to beat the wall of flesh, and while you can fight the wall of flesh at any time actually beating the wall of flesh all but requires you to collect and beat the <a href="bosses.html">bosses</a> that come before the wall of flesh and only then do you move onto <a href="hardmode.html">hardmode</a>.
