            <h2 class="center">What is Hardmode?</h2>

            Hardmode is the second (and last) phase of your Terraria world. You enter hardmode by beating the wall of flesh, when this happens then your world will transform from Pre-harmode to hardmode. so what does hardmode change? Hardmode adds a new biome (The Hallow), it makes your evil biome (either the corruption or the crimson depending on which one is in your world) start to spread, it changes the dungeon enemies to be harder, it adds more events, adds new drops, more items, more enemies, more craftables, and many more things. Hardmode is where Terraria shines and where you'll spend most of your journey playing Terraria.

            <h2 class="center">How to beat Terraria</h2>

            To beat Terraria you have to beat Moon Lord. You will finish Terraria in hardmode as that's where you can summon the final boss Moon Lord. In order to beat Terraria the only required bosses are Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, The Twins, The Destroyer, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Golem, Lunatic Cultist, Then Moon Lord. While any other boss besides the ones I've mentioned previosuly are optional it is greatly recommended that you beat most of the bosses because it greatly reduces the amount of effort it takes to advance in Terraria.
